# second-pet-project

This is my second pet project.

It is a prototype of an online store.

First of all I used in this project such technologies as HTML and CSS to build the main blocks of the store.
I have studied for this the basics of HTML. Then I moved on to a more in-depth study of HTML, namely page structuring
Also I studied basics of CSS such as features, selectors, blocks etc.
Then I started to study Flexbox, Grid Layout, Adaptive layout.

Now I've started to learning JavaScript.

In the learning process, I used:
https://developer.mozilla.org/ - this site helped me to learn the basics of HTML and CSS;
https://learn.javascript.ru/ - this site helped me to learn the basics JavaScript;

In addition, I'm studying at the full-stack JavaScript developer course at the GeekBrains online university,
and it helps me to get to know the layuot and programming featured better.
